# Electromizer

### Overview

Welcome to Electromizer, an innovative project designed to revolutionize home electronics automation
based on electricity prices. At the heart of this initiative is the goal to optimize power usage
by seamlessly adapting to fluctuating electric prices. When prices are low, Electromizer ensures
your system operates at full capacity, maximizing efficiency. Conversely, during periods of high
prices, the system intelligently minimizes usage, providing both cost savings and environmental
benefits.
